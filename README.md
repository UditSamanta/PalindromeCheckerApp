# PalindromeCheckerApp


# 📌 Overview

PalindromeCheckerApp is a simple Java console application that checks whether a given word, phrase, or number is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "madam", "racecar", "121").


# 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

Practice Java string manipulation

Understand control flow (loops, conditionals)

Work with user input

Implement basic algorithm logic

# ⚙️ How It Works

The user enters a word, phrase, or number.

The program processes the input:

Removes spaces (optional)

Converts characters to lowercase (optional)

The program reverses the input.

It compares the original input with the reversed version.

It prints whether the input is a palindrome.

# ▶️ How to Run Requirements

Java JDK 8 or higher

Any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or terminal

### Steps

Clone or download the project.

Open the project in your IDE.
